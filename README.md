> Note: This is my personal starter template for single-purpose libraries that I intend to publish to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com). To get started, you can pull down this template `npx degit https://github.com/tnez/starter-npm-pkg your-new-package-name`. Then search through the project (you can use something like `rg package-name` depending on what tools you have available) and replace any instances of the `package-name` placeholder with the name you intend for your new library.
